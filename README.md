# Overview:
Based on the ratings given by different users for a set of movies, we are trying predicting which set movies are better and should be watched.

## Note
Important point here .<br />
For a movie say XYZ user1 can give a rating say 5 .<br /> 
For the same movie user2 can give 4 stars , user3 can give 2 stars and so on. What we are doing here is that we are finding the average ratings of every movie here.<br /> 
So if try to compare predicted value and average value with the ratings given by different users, it will be a bad idea.Its like comparing average=3 with 1,2,3,4,5 and saying less accuracy is obtained.
**So please don't go for accuracy in this project.***
