Based on the ratings given by different users for a set of movies, predicting which movies are better and should be watched.
1 Imp point here
For a movie say XYZ user1 can give rating =5 
For the same movie , user2 can give 4 , user3=2..........
We are finding the avg of ratings here. 
So if compare predicted avg value with the ratings given by different user, it will be a bad idea.
Its like comparing avg=3 with 1,2,3,4,5 and saying less accuracy is obtained
